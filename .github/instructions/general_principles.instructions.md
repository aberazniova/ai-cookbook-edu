## General Principles

- Prefer descriptive names for methods, functions, and variables instead of adding comments to explain them.
- If a method or function becomes large or requires explanatory comments, split it into smaller pieces to keep code readable.
- Avoid shortening variable names; prefer clear, descriptive names (e.g. `user` instead of `usr`).

### Formatting

- Always add a new line at the end of each file.
- Use **2 spaces** for indentation in all code files.
